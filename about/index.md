I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science">University of Virginia</a>. Currently, I am working with <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lufeng/index.html">Dr. Lu Feng</a> on Cyber-physical Systems. Prior to UVA, I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from <a href="http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm"> Sun Yat-sen University</a>, Guangzhou China.
